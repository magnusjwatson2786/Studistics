# STUDISTICS

This program was made for the purpose of helping students who are interested in keeping track of their daily study/code hours and visualizing it on different plots to see what's lacking, track improvements and better understand their own unique patterns.
I have used this app to track my code hours while working on this app as well as other projects.

>Clone the repo and double-click on *main.bat* file to run the program.
