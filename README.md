**UpDate** : **After working on this project for almost a week and adding multiple new features and a totally new UI, unfortunately, i lost all the code i wrote due to a harddisk failure :-(  and now i have decided to proceed on other new projects instead of re-writing all the code again. But this is not the end of it, I shall come back to it later. Meanwhile, if anyone wishes to contribute to this project, feel free to fork it or [contact](mailto:mearunprabhakar14@gmail.com) me, toodles.**

# STUDISTICS

This program was made for the purpose of helping students who are interested in keeping track of their daily study/code hours and visualizing it on different plots to see what's lacking, track improvements and better understand their own unique patterns.
I have used this app to track my code hours while working on this app as well as other projects.

>Clone the repo and double-click on *main.bat* file to run the program.
